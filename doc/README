Overview
========

**pdf2djvu** creates DjVu_ files from PDF files.

It's able to extract:

- graphics,
- text layer,
- hyperlinks,
- document outline (bookmarks),
- metadata (including XMP_ metadata).

pdf2djvu is developed primarily for Unix-like systems,
but a Windows distribution is available too.

Prerequisites
=============

The following software is required to build pdf2djvu:

* C++11 compiler;
* GNU make;
* DjVuLibre_ (≥ 3.5.25), both the library and the command line tools;
* Poppler_ (≥ 0.62), including xpdf headers;
* pkg-config_.

The following software is recommended:

* gettext_ for internationalization;
* Exiv2_ (≥ 0.21) and libuuid (part of util-linux or e2fsprogs)
  for correctly dealing with XMP metadata;
* GraphicsMagick_ for the ``--fg-colors=N`` option.

For the ``-j``/``--jobs`` option, the compiler must support OpenMP_.

To run the tests, the following software is needed:

* Python 3.

To correctly convert some PDF files (mostly in Chinese, Japanese or
Korean), the poppler-data_ package must be installed.

About this fork
===============

This repository ports the tests of the original repository to Python 3.

The process involved the *2to3* tool and manual fixes afterwards to get the existing tests to pass.

Due to the upstream repository having been archived (`Issue #157`_), there will be no pull request. Additionally, this never was considered as desirable by upstream, where the corresponding issue has been marked as *wontfix*: `Issue #141`_.

Please note that I do not have any direct plans to actually do further work on *pdf2djvu* itself at the moment, as I am not actually using it myself. If someone wants to step on maintaining the actual C++ code, feel free to open a corresponding issue to further discuss this topic.

Differences from upstream
-------------------------

* Tests require Python ≥ 3.6.
* Migrate tests from *nose* to plain *unittest* stdlib module.
* Conform tests to PEP8 coding style.
