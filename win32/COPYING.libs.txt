The FreeType 2 font engine is copyrighted work and cannot be used legally
without a software license. In order to make this project usable to a vast
majority of developers, we distribute it under two mutually exclusive
open-source licenses.

This means that *you* must choose *one* of the two licenses described below,
then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in any of your
projects or products.

- The FreeType License, found in the file ‘FTL.TXT’, which is similar to the
  original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces you to
  explicitly cite the FreeType project in your product's documentation. All
  details are in the license file. This license is suited to products which
  don't use the GNU General Public License.

  Note that this license is compatible to the GNU General Public License
  version 3, but not version 2.

- The GNU General Public License version 2, found in ‘GPLv2.TXT’ (any later
  version can be used also), for programs which already use the GPL. Note
  that the FTL is incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause.

The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar to that of the
X Window System. It is compatible to the above two licenses.

The gzip module uses the zlib license which too is compatible to the above two
licenses.
